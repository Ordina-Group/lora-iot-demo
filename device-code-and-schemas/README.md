Device-code-and-schemas
=======================
This folder contains the Arduino and Sodaq Mbili code to allow the booze-o-meter application to get data from the booze column.

PURPOSE:
--------
Code for both the Arduino and Sodaq Mbili boards, as well as the wiring diagram to wire it all together.
The wiring diagram is a Fritzing diagram and can be opened in that application. 

- [Download](http://fritzing.org/download/)

When starting it all up, please take the following into account:

- Either power the Arduino and Sodaq Mbili boards first, and then fill the column with liquid,
- OR remove the sensors from the column, and re-insert them one by one, with a 15 second interval from bottom to top!

DISCLAIMER:
-----------
This is hacky code, it can be unclean in places, despite efforts to keep it as clean as possible.
If you have constructive criticism please open an issue, or even better fix the code and make a PR.
